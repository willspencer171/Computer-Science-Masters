## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module students will be able to:

1. Critically analyse the principal ideas and techniques of artificial intelligence.

2. Apply AI search to solve problems that may be represented as states, transitions and goals.

3. Design logical systems that are able to represent knowledge and make decisions.

4. Apply machine learning techniques to create AI agents that can learn from observed data.

5. Critically evaluate the societal impact of AI including legal and ethical issues.

## What to look forward to

All code written in this module will be done in Java using BellSoft Liberica JDK 21 and the core text will be Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach 4th edition by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell

The summative assessment will be a written examination rather than a practical project.
